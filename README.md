# Interactive maps with leaflet


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to generating and using interactive maps with R and leaflet. Leaflet renders maps by seamlessly joining several, individually requested vector tiles, with optional overlays and vector objects layered on top. Leaflet was initially a popular open source library for Javascript and has since been ported to R.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) Learn the basics of tiled maps and how to generate them,  (2) How to transform a dataset and visualize its data in a map, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
